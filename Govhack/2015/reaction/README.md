# Reaction - If Data Then That [2015]

(Govhack 2015 entry)

IFFF for Aussie data.

Reaction is a powerful data manipulation and monitoring tool. It allows you to stay up to date with Aussie data by automatically sending information at the right time.

At the heart of Reaction is its two key components - Triggers and Actions.

Actions are te way Reaction interacts with you. They allow it to email you and control your social media.

Triggers allow you to watch data and cause actions to be run. They can be used to monitor the datasets built into Reaction or any data imported as CSV/JSON files.

Triggers and Actions are combined to create Reactions.
