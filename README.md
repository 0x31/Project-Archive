=====================

I'll be revising this code soon. That will also include writing a bit about it here.

This code simulates objects (currently limited to rectangles) that can collide, float or fall due to gravity. There's no rotation yet. It does have friction, different materials, collision restitution (e.g. the orange rectangle in the previews bounces more), immovable objects (with infinite mass).

At its current limited stage, it looks like this:

With gravity:

Without gravity:  
![NoGravity](preview/NoGravity.gif)
