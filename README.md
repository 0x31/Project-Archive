# rnutjs
rnutjs is a web-based IDE, assembler and emulator for the Australian National University (ANU)'s architecture rPeANUt.

The project is written entirely in Javascript (and HTML/CSS), allowing it to reach a large variety of platforms.

It makes use of HTML5 local storage and the Dropbox API to store and synchronize files across sessions.

The IDE is mobile-web-app capable, allowing it to be run on mobile devices without the bothersome UI of the browser.
